# objects-to-web
<sub>The name has yet to be fully fleshed out.</sub>
> [!NOTE]
> This project is intended to be used as a college project, as such do not expect much maintenance past December 2024.  Recommended to place the jar file within a folder, since it will create files upon usage and you don't want any of your existing files to be overwritten.  The creation layout was temporarily adjusted and will need to be adjusted later.


CPSC 4900 Group Project - Involves using a GUI that has GUI object elements within that are to be used to, in some way, generate and adjust a webpage or site.  The primary usage is adjusting.


## Idea

A user-friendly GUI that generates HTML/PHP pages with an identical style, but the contents of the page can be modified via the GUI.  The GUI assists in the organization and potentially navigation of the pages.

## Product Vision
<details>
<summary> The product vision being used for the group project. </summary>
 
FOR individuals looking to set up uniform website pages, website developers, or hobbyists WHO wish to spend more time on the contents within the page rather than the code behind the page.  Small businesses can also benefit from the product considering they may have limited resources, teams, or budget.  The target set of customers are information website managers that are looking to reduce the labor cost and ensure the developers or hobbyists will have more time to work on other tasks.  The TEK-GUI is an open-source application software which focuses vertically on website development THAT facilitates the creation and overall management of webpages whilst ensuring that the contents are abstracted into a more understandable format. This abstraction allows customers, with no technical background, to create a well-designed product without heavy expenses or frustrations.  It implements a user-friendly graphical user interface, GUI, that will allow users to generate HTML/PHP pages with a consistent style.  UNLIKE Fandom, whose web page editing user interface, whether old or new, forces the user to have an overall sluggish experience, the focus of TEK-GUI is to speed up the process and make it more enjoyable visually.  Not only can TEK-GUI speed up the process, it can also allow for multiple pages to be adjusted in quick succession, whereas Fandom requires the editor to publish and navigate to another page before editing.  OUR PRODUCT filters out the complex information and allows for the customer to navigate through the information at a faster pace when searching for an unknown item through the contents of the page.  Reducing the time cost of creating and maintaining the code will greatly improve customer performance and overall experience.

The parent may be a directory instead of a file, but it will still be considered an Object, just void of contents aside from the name and relationship. | 5 hours, 2 people | 5 |
